- Bugs relating to array initializers: (fixed)
	- Array initializer wasn't generating acceptable MCode because of the latest addition. Added ActualDimension.
	- Array initializer with more than one dimension had incorrect element type in DJava. added (dimension - 1) into ArrayAllocation.TypeDescriptor.initialize(Type t).
- Static variables increase also object's variable count.
