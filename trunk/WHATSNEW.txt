What's new in Jeliot 3.4.0

+ Improved editor with Syntax Highlighting (thanks to JEdit)
+ Array Initializers, speed up 
+ Start Jeliot animation from any method in your class, useful if you don't have a main method
+ History view, want to repeat the last part of the animation, use the History view
+ Call Tree view, interested in how recursion works, have a look at the call tree view
+ Logical operators && || now work in shortcircuit
+ Improved object-oriented suppor, like Static Field Access
+ Start Jeliot with a filename as a parameter like "jeliot If.java", it will look first in Examples


Other new features

+ Support for CASE statements
+ Run until, just indicate a line and the animation will fast-forward to it
+ System.out.println and System.out.print support, for the shake of being "standard"
