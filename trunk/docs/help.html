<h2>Opening a file<br>
</h2>

<br>
 <br>
 To open a file, click on the Open button. A file selection menu will appear.
Choose one of the files, say Example.java, by clicking on its name. The file
name that you chose will appear in the File name field at the bottom of the
file selection menu. Click on Open. The file will opened and its Java source
code will appear in the left frame of the display.<br>

<h2>Compilation</h2>
 To compile the program, click on the compile button that appears in the
button bar in the lower part of the display. If there are no compilation
errors, the blue "curtain" on the right frame of the display will open.<br>
 The curtain will reveal the "stage" upon which the animation will take place.<br>

<h2>Animation</h2>
 When the compilation is finished, the button bar at the bottom of the screen
changes its appearance:<br>
 To return to edit mode, click on Edit. Click on Play to run the animation
continuously and on Step to run the animation step by step.<br>

<h3>Continuous animation</h3>
 As each instruction is executed, it is highlighted in the left frame of
the display. The animation itself is performed on the stage on the right
frame. <br>
 Most of the stage is used to animate execution of instructions, but it also
contains an area to display the variables and a constant store. Below the
stage is a frame that is used to display the output of the program:<br>
 You can think of the Output frame as representing the screen of your computer.<br>
 You can control the speed of the continuous animation by using the slider
that appears beneath the buttons:<br>
 Drag it to the left to decrease the speed and to the right to increase it
(or simply click anywhere on the scale).<br>
 Once the animation has started, the Pause and Rewind buttons will become
active. Clicking on Pause will stop the animation to allow you time to study
the display and to reflect on your work. Press Play to continue, or Step to
enter step-by-step animation. If you wish to restart the animation, click
on Rewind.<br>

<h3>Step-by-step animation</h3>
 Clicking on the Step button will cause the current statement of the program
to be executed and animated. Then the animation will stop and wait for your
next command. Animation is usually run step-by-step as it gives you a chance
to examine the program and the stage.<br>
 You can also click Rewind to restart the program, Play to change to continuous
animation and Edit to change to edit mode in order to modify the program.<br>
<h2>Editing a program</h2>
 When you first open a file you are in edit mode. After animating a program
you can return to edit mode by clicking on Edit.<br>
 The standard editing keys can be used. In addition, block operations can
be performed from the menu bar. <br>
 Select some text using the mouse and click on Copy or Cut. In both cases,
the text will be copied to an internal area of memory called the clipboard.
The difference is that Copy make a new copy of the text to put on the clipboard,
while Cut removes the original text and puts it on the clipboard.<br>
 Move the mouse to a new position in the text and click Paste; the text on
the clipboard will be copied to this position. The text is not removed from
the clipboard until the next Cut or Copy operation, so you can continue to
Paste it to other positions.<br>
 When you are finished editing, click Save to save your program.<br>
<h2>Creating a new file</h2>
 To create a new file (program), click on New on the menu bar. You will enter
edit mode with an outline of a simple Java program in the left frame. The
comment // Your algorithm goes here shows where to start writing the statements
of your program.<br>
