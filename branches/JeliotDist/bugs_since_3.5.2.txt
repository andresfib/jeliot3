- Bugs relating to array initializers: (fixed)
	- Array initializer wasn't generating acceptable MCode because of the latest addition. Added ActualDimension.
	- Array initializer with more than one dimension had incorrect element type in DJava. added (dimension - 1) into ArrayAllocation.TypeDescriptor.initialize(Type t).
- Static variables increase also object's variable count. (fixed)
- Overlapping mnemonics in edit and call tree. (fixed)
- Menu items can be used even though the menu is being disabled. (fixed)
- Wrong assignments when self assigning post-increments k = k++; (fixed, however the visualization isn't very intuitive)
- NullPointerExceptions are not reported to the user as his fault but ours. (fixed)
- Remember last opened directory (done)
- Objects returned from methods to non declared variables raises Runtime exception (fixed)
- Left hand side of assignments evaluated twice (i++ is evaluated twice array[i++]=j;) (fixed, but because there are several places that needed to be modified we would need a proper regression testing)
- Pressing undo after saving makes the whole program code disappear because of incorrect handling of compound undoable edits. (fixed, plus added support for different compound undoable edits if necessary in future)
- Handling of array accesses and object field accesses as left hand side operands on assignments, compound assignments and pre/post-increments/decrements were handled against JLS. (fixed)
