question = You found the error, why do you think there is an error in the animation?

topicList = overriding, implicit, forUpdate

overriding.option0 = The wrong method was called.
overriding.option1 = The parameter values were misplaced.
overriding.option2 = The reference to the calling object did not point to the correct object.
overriding.option3 = None of the others.

implicit.option0 = The implicit call to the superclass constructor was not made.
implicit.option1 = There was not space allocated for all the variables.
implicit.option2 = Constructor did not initialize all the attributes. 
implicit.option3 = None of the others.

forUpdate.option0 = The update statement was executed ahead of time.
forUpdate.option1 = The initial value of the for loop is wrong.
forUpdate.option2 = I cannot say.
forUpdate.option3 = None of the others.

overriding.comment0 = Right, that was the reason why the animation go wrong. Jeliot should have not called the method of the superclass.
overriding.comment1 = The method call had passed the parameters correctly, did Jeliot call the right method?
overriding.comment2 = Not quite, are you sure? Run the animation again.
overriding.comment3 = Keep looking, the answer is one of the others.

implicit.comment0 = Right, you found the error. Java needs to execute the constructor of the superclass before proceeding with the one constructor of its class.
implicit.comment1 = No! All the variables were allocated by Jeliot, keep looking.
implicit.comment2 = No! All attributes were correctly initialized.
implicit.comment3 = Keep looking, the answer is one of the other three.

forUpdate.comment0 = Right, the update must happen after the block of the for loop.
forUpdate.comment1 = Are you sure? The initial value of the for loop is the right one.
forUpdate.comment2 = Look at your notes on how the for loop works!
forUpdate.comment3 = Keep looking, the answer is one of the others.
