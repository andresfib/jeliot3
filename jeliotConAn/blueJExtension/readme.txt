Installing extensions


Extensions are installed by placing the extension jar file into an extension directory. 
BlueJ has three separate locations for extensions, each giving the extension a different
scope. The locations are:



Location                                           Extensions installed here are available... 


<BLUEJ_HOME>/lib/extensions/                       ...for all users of this system in all projects. 

<USER_HOME>/.bluej/extensions/ (Unix) or 
<USER_HOME>\bluej\extensions\ (Windows)            ...for a single user for all projects. 

<BLUEJ_PROJECT>/extensions/                        ...for this project only.
